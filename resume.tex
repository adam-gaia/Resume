\sepperator{7in}{titlebox}{titlebox!40}{Work Experience}
\textbf{Software Engineer - Sarcos Robotics} \hfill  November 2019 (intern) to present (full time)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robot Service Manager
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Built and maintained an on-robot daemon that provided a REST API for interacting with services running on the robots

		\item Reduced the firmware update process from 1 hour to 10 minutes by building a CD pipeline distribute firmware to robots without human interaction

		\item Worked closely with test engineers to create internal tools for starting/stopping robot operation

		\item Used websockets to stream filtered runtime logs to robot deploy stations during robot operation

		\item Created and containerized on-robot services as dockerized python apps

		\item Wrote/tested/debugged python code
	\end{itemize}
	\vspace{1mm}

	\item Reduced the on-robot team's main codebase CI runtime from 40 minutes to 5 minutes by removing redundancy and running jobs in parallel

	\item Created a pipeline to transfer 100s of GB runtime logs from the robot to cloud storage after operation

	\item Worked with test engineers to debug and resolve robot bring-up issues on the test floor

	\item Wrote Ansible scripts to provision robot deploy stations (linux computers)

    %\item Lead developer of an on-robot, service-queuing daemon. Created and containerized services using Docker

    %\item Wrote/optimized/debugged c++ code for realtime robot operating system

    %\item Automated robot bring-up, software update, and code compile processes \\
\end{itemize}

% Uintah Scientific Computing
\noindent \textbf{Scientific Computing Intern - University of Utah} \hfill  August 2017 to November 2019
%\textit{University of Utah Engineering Department, Uintah Project (PDE-solving simulation software)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parallelized a post-processing script, reducing run-time from 18 hours to 3 minutes with 400+ GB input files
    \item Created Bash scripts to automate the queuing of remote simulations. Added automatic job error feedback
    %\item Created a Python script to recursively compare tree-structured simulation spec files for similar nodes
    \item Used Linux command line to run simulations on remote high-performance computing centers
    %\item Saved countless hours of time by writing Bash scripts to automate repetitive tasks
    %\item Updated legacy MATLAB post-processing tools to handle current outputs
    %\item Documented 3 new features in the user guide.
